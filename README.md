## 🚀 Overview
As part of my #Allstadevopschallenge, I built a **Game Day Notification App** that keeps fans updated on NBA schedules in real time! 🏀  

This project leverages **AWS Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge** to automate notifications, ensuring fans never miss a game. Here’s how it works:

🔹 **AWS Lambda** – Fetches game schedules and processes the data  
🔹 **AWS SNS** – Sends notifications via email and SMS  
🔹 **AWS EventBridge** – Automates the trigger to run daily  

By integrating an external **NBA API**, this system pulls real-time game data and pushes updates straight to subscribed users. No manual intervention needed—just seamless, serverless automation!

## 💡 Key Takeaways & Business Benefits

✅ **AWS Lambda**: Reduces operational overhead by eliminating server management, allowing teams to focus on application logic instead of infrastructure.  
✅ **AWS SNS**: Provides instant and scalable notifications, ensuring organizations can engage users across multiple channels (email, SMS, mobile push).  
✅ **AWS EventBridge**: Automates workflows, reducing manual intervention and ensuring critical processes run on schedule with minimal latency.  

Organizations leveraging these services can **enhance customer engagement, improve operational efficiency, and reduce infrastructure costs**, making cloud-native solutions a game-changer!
